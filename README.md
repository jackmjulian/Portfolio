# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio of work created while learning full-stack engineering at CodeCademy.

Porject Overniew:
For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.
